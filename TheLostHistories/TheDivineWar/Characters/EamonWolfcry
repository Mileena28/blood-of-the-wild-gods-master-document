## Character Summary
Eamon represents the grounding force of human love and practical wisdom in a world increasingly dominated by divine power and supernatural transformation. His character explores the question of whether purely mortal devotion can sustain relationships when one partner transcends human limitations.

As a versatile laborer, he embodies human adaptability and resourcefulness—the ability to tackle whatever problems arise through diverse skills, knowledge, and hard work rather than magic. This makes him both essential to his community and potentially inadequate against supernatural threats, creating internal conflict between pride in his abilities and fear of his limitations.

His relationship with Astrid serves as the emotional core of his character development. His deep love for her is complicated by terror at losing her, leading to moments of cruel honesty when fear overcomes compassion. His harsh words after Natalia's death reveal how protective instincts can become destructive when filtered through panic and helplessness.

The encounter with Silas presents him with the fundamental choice that defines his character: maintain human integrity or accept divine power to better protect those he loves. His refusal demonstrates principled courage but also creates potential future conflict as Astrid's transformation progresses and new threats emerge.

Eamon's heritage as one of The Free People suggests he comes from humans who maintained their dignity and independence despite divine oppression. This background may explain his distrust of divine offers and his commitment to facing reality on purely human terms, even when those terms seem inadequate.

His character arc likely involves learning to love and support someone who is fundamentally changing, finding value in his own purely human contributions, and discovering that emotional constancy and practical wisdom have their own irreplaceable power in a world of supernatural chaos.

Through Eamon, the story explores whether human love can bridge the gap between mortal and divine, whether protection can exist without control, and whether the everyday heroism of honest work and faithful devotion can matter in a world of gods and monsters.
