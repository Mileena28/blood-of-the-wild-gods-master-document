## Character Summary
Leika represents the ancient authority of divine tradition faced with unprecedented challenges to its fundamental assumptions. As the Mother of Mountains, she embodies the strength and stability that has anchored reality since creation's dawn, but her very nature makes her ill-equipped to handle the adaptive challenges of a changing cosmos.

Her geological perspective grants her incredible patience and endurance, but blinds her to the immediate needs of those who exist in shorter timescales. She sees strength only in terms of what can endure unchanged, missing the resilience that comes from flexibility and growth. Her contempt for mortal concerns reflects not mere callousness, but a fundamental inability to comprehend perspectives radically different from her own eternal, mountain-deep certainty.

Leika's tragedy lies in her genuine desire to protect and preserve the cosmic order she helped create, while being constitutionally incapable of recognizing when that order has become a constraint rather than a support. She defends divine privilege not from malice but from sincere belief that hierarchy and stability are necessary for existence itself.

Her relationship with other gods reveals the deep fractures beginning to appear in the divine order—old alliances strained by new challenges, traditional authority questioned by emerging philosophies, and the possibility that the very foundations she has spent eternity building might need to evolve or risk collapse.

As the Divine War approaches, Leika stands at the center of a conflict between preservation and transformation, representing the tragic nobility of those who would rather break than bend. Her ultimate fate may determine whether the cosmos moves toward adaptive growth or catastrophic stagnation—whether the mountains she has raised will provide shelter for new life, or become monuments to an order too rigid to survive its own success.

Through Leika, we see the dark side of strength without wisdom, authority without empathy, and the danger of allowing good intentions to calcify into oppressive certainty. She is neither villain nor hero, but something more complex—a force of nature whose very virtues have become obstacles to the growth and adaptation that changing times demand.
