## Character Summary
Tanneus G'Raja embodies the tragedy of the scholar who discovers that his life's greatest passion is also his greatest danger. Born among pragmatic relic-hunters who valued divine artifacts for their material worth, he chose instead to pursue their historical significance, believing that truth and knowledge were inherently noble pursuits. His academic career began with the progressive conviction that suppressed voices deserved hearing and that traditional restrictions represented prejudice rather than wisdom.

Through decades of increasingly unconventional research, Tanneus uncovered the Lost Histories—accounts of divine beings whose love for mortals led to cosmic catastrophe. His discoveries gradually revealed that the divine silence he had raged against was not abandonment but love, that the traditional boundaries he had condemned as prejudice were actually protection, and that his own progressive idealism mirrored the destructive compassion that had nearly ended reality itself.

The profound irony of Tanneus's character lies in his transformation into the very cautionary tale he was documenting. While cataloguing how divine love becomes divine catastrophe, he was simultaneously loving knowledge with the same dangerous completeness. His scholarly obsession paralleled the gods' romantic obsession—both caring so deeply about something beyond their ability to safely possess that the caring itself became destructive.

His final testament serves as both achievement and warning: a masterwork of historical synthesis that simultaneously demonstrates the danger of pursuing such synthesis too far. Tanneus succeeded in uncovering the truth about divine nature and the reasons for their silence, but the knowledge consumed him, leaving him "dying of truth" in the same way the gods died of love.

Through Tanneus, we see that consciousness itself is tragedy, but that the tragedy becomes worth bearing only when it serves something greater than itself. His willing sacrifice of sanity and life to preserve these dangerous truths ensures that future generations will have both the knowledge and the warning needed to understand their own choices. He becomes a bridge between the divine tragedies he documented and the mortal tragedies yet to come, proof that the pattern of love-as-destruction extends beyond gods to encompass any conscious being that cares too deeply about anything beyond itself.

His death by truth mirrors the deaths by love he spent his career documenting, completing the thematic circle that demonstrates how knowledge and love are merely different expressions of the same cosmic force—the dangerous tendency of consciousness to reach beyond its safe boundaries in pursuit of something infinitely valuable and infinitely destructive.

In the end, Tanneus G'Raja achieved exactly what he sought: perfect knowledge of divine nature. The cost—his transformation into a cautionary tale about the price of such knowledge—was not an unfortunate side effect but an inevitable consequence. He became the living proof of his own discoveries, the scholar who demonstrated through his own destruction that some truths are too vast for mortal minds to safely contain.

His final words, "I would do it all again," reveal the deepest truth of all: that consciousness, once awakened to the possibility of understanding, cannot choose ignorance, even when ignorance would mean survival. The scholar's curse is not just seeing patterns across time, but being unable to stop seeing them, even when the seeing becomes the seer's undoing.
