## Character Summary
Khali represents the tragedy of divine love attempting to exist within mortal limitations. As an ancient goddess who chose to live quietly among humans, she embodies the highest ideals of service, compassion, and protective care. Her decision to experience mortal emotionsâ€”especially loveâ€”makes her vulnerable to the very jealousy and cruelty she had spent centuries protecting others from.

Her relationship with Eshuah demonstrates the possibility of genuine connection between divine and semi-divine beings, while her friendship with Jade shows how even gods can be deceived by carefully maintained appearances. Her murder is not just the death of an individual, but the destruction of innocence itselfâ€”both her naive belief in others' goodness and the loss of a protective force that had shielded mortals from nightmares for millennia.

The transformation of her story from gentle healer to corrupting witch reflects humanity's tendency to rewrite inconvenient truths. Her posthumous slander serves political necessity while destroying the memory of someone who dedicated her existence to others' wellbeing. In this way, Khali becomes a symbol not just of sacrificial love, but of how power can corrupt even the memory of goodness.

Through her character, we see that the greatest tragedy is not the death of the divine among mortals, but how quickly that divine presence can be forgotten, distorted, and ultimately blamed for the very evils it sought to prevent. Khali dies as she livedâ€”trying to protect others, even from themselvesâ€”but her legacy is stolen and perverted by those who benefit from painting gentleness as corruption and love as manipulation.

Her story reminds us that true divinity often walks quietly among us, asking nothing and giving everything, only to be destroyed by the very humanity it serves. In a world that transforms murder into heroism and victims into villains, Khali's truth survives only in hidden records and whispered memoriesâ€”a testament to the power of love and the tragedy of its destruction by jealousy, fear, and political expedience.
