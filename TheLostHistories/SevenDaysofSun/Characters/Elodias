## Divine Psychology
- **Immortal Perspective:**
  - Time measured not in years but in reunions and separations
  - Mortal concepts of "moving on" or "healing" are meaningless to immortal consciousness
  - Every moment without Senia feels like an eternity; every moment with her too brief to register
  - Perfect memory makes each loss as fresh and devastating as the first

- **Love as Addiction:**
  - Physical withdrawal symptoms during separation (cosmic storms, reality distortion)
  - Increasing tolerance - needs longer reunions to achieve same emotional satisfaction
  - Inability to function normally without the object of addiction
  - Destructive behavior that harms both self and others, including the beloved

- **Denial Mechanisms:**
  - Frames curse-breaking as "giving up" rather than "letting go"
  - Interprets Senia's repeated deaths as tragedy rather than natural consequence
  - Believes each reunion validates the choice rather than recognizing the pattern of harm
  - Focuses on moments of joy to justify eternal cycles of suffering

## The Seven-Day Pattern

  - Initial meeting in mortal form, instant attraction and connection
  - Growing comfort and intimacy as mortal personality meshes with divine essence
  - Hope that this incarnation might be different, special, permanent

- **Day 3-4: Deepening Love**
  - Mortal Senia beginning to sense something greater about their connection
  - Elodias sharing carefully selected truths about their eternal bond
  - Both experiencing unprecedented depth of feeling and understanding

- **Day 5: The Remembrance**
  - Senia's divine memories flooding back, overwhelming her mortal form
  - Physical transformation beginning as divinity strains against mortal constraints
  - Elodias experiencing joy of recognition mixed with dread of approaching loss

- **Day 6-7: Deterioration and Death**
  - Senia's mortal body failing under weight of divine consciousness
  - Desperate attempts to prolong time together, bending reality at the edges
  - Final moments at the cliff, watching sunset together as she dissolves into light

- **Post-Death: Grief and Searching**
  - Environmental catastrophe as Elodias's grief reshapes local reality
  - Period of wandering and searching, sensing for signs of her rebirth
  - Cycle begins anew when he locates her next incarnation

- **His Blindness:** Complete failure to recognize her emotional attachment and growing obsession
- **Inadvertent Cruelty:** Kindness and gratitude that fed her hopes without intention
- **Current Understanding:** Recognition of his role in creating the situation that led to the curse
- **Ongoing Consequence:** Bound to her through the curse she created, making her eternally present in his story
- **Thematic Mirror:** She represents what he could become - love twisted into destructive obsession

## Character Summary
Elodias embodies the tragic figure of divine love that has become destructive through its very perfection. As god of the moon and tides, he was designed to be Senia's eternal complement - the contemplative darkness to her radiant light, the patient depth to her active warmth. Their cosmic love story should have been one of perfect balance and harmony, two divine forces maintaining universal stability through their union.

Instead, he has become the perfect example of how even the purest love can transform into something harmful when it refuses to accept limitation or loss. His immortal devotion to Senia transcends death, time, and cosmic consequence, but this very transcendence has become their prison. He loves her so completely that he cannot conceive of a universe in which she might be better off without him, and this failure of imagination condemns them both to eternal repetition of their tragedy.

The curse that binds them is ultimately unnecessary - Elodias's own nature has already made him incapable of the choice that would free them. Malritha's magic merely formalized what was already true: that his love for Senia is so fundamental to his existence that abandoning it would require him to stop being himself. He would rather watch her die a thousand deaths than experience the emptiness of a universe without her presence.

What makes Elodias particularly tragic is his awareness of his own destructiveness. He understands the cosmic mathematics of their situation - his presence triggers her divine awakening, which leads inevitably to her death, which causes him grief that reshapes reality and harms countless innocents. He knows he is the problem, knows he could end their suffering by choosing to forget her, knows that his love has become a weapon pointed at everything he claims to cherish.

Yet this knowledge changes nothing. If anything, it deepens his tragedy by adding the weight of conscious choice to unconscious compulsion. He is not a victim of fate but an active participant in their destruction, choosing his need for her over her freedom, his grief over her peace, his love over her life, again and again across eternity.

Through Elodias, we see how love itself can become a form of violence when it demands possession rather than celebrating existence, when it prioritizes the lover's needs over the beloved's wellbeing, when it chooses intensity over sustainability. His perfect memory ensures that each cycle carries the accumulated weight of all previous losses, making him not just a god in love but a being literally dying of love, slowly dissolving under the weight of his own emotions.

He represents the shadow side of romantic idealism - the belief that true love conquers all, that it justifies any sacrifice, that it transforms suffering into nobility. His story reveals these beliefs as beautiful lies that can lead to the very destruction they claim to prevent. In choosing love over wisdom, passion over compassion, reunion over release, he becomes both the architect and prisoner of his own eternal tragedy.

The moon will always chase the sun across the heavens, drawn by a love that predates creation and will outlast existence itself. But chasing is not catching, pursuit is not possession, and love that cannot let go eventually strangles what it seeks to protect. Elodias is proof that even gods can learn to mistake obsession for devotion, that even divine love can become profoundly selfish, and that sometimes the greatest act of love is the one we refuse to perform - the choice to set the beloved free.
