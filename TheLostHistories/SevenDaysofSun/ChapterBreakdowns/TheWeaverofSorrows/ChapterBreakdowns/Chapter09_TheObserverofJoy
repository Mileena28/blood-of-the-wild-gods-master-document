# Adaptive Worldbuilding Chapter Analysis

## Chapter Overview
* **Citation:** [Blood of the Wild Gods: The Lost Histories, "The Weaver of Sorrows" - Chapter IX: "The Observer of Joy"]
* **Summary:** Malritha uses scrying magic to obsessively stalk Elodias and Senia's divine reunion and intimate relationship. What begins as supposed scholarly observation transforms into compulsive voyeuristic stalking, sexual obsession, and psychological breakdown. Her inability to accept rejection and her entitled belief that she deserves Elodias's love corrupts her into a hateful, delusional person who ultimately creates the eternal curse to punish them for not giving her what she believes she's owed.

* **Worldbuilding Impact:** Demonstrates how advanced magical abilities can be weaponized for stalking and harassment, reveals detailed divine realm geography, and shows the creation of cosmic-level curses born from personal obsession and entitlement. Establishes that individual psychological corruption can have universe-altering consequences when combined with sufficient magical power.
