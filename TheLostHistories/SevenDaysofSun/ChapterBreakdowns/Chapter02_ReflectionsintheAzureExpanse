# Adaptive Worldbuilding Chapter Analysis

## Chapter Overview
* **Citation:** [Blood of the Wild Gods: The Lost Histories, "Seven Days of Sun" - Chapter 2: "Reflections in the Azure Expanse"]
* **Summary:** Elodias and Senia's first date unfolds along the shoreline, revealing deeper supernatural elements when Senia discovers his journal filled with sketches and observations of women who appear to be her across different lifetimes and social positions. The revelation shatters their budding romance when Elodias confirms he has loved "all these women," leading to Senia's devastated flight and escalating environmental responses from the Azure Expanse.

* **Worldbuilding Impact:** Establishes the core supernatural mechanism of the world—reincarnation or soul-cycling where the same souls meet across different lifetimes and circumstances. Confirms that supernatural beings can track and love the same soul through multiple incarnations, and that their emotional turmoil directly affects the natural world's behavior.
