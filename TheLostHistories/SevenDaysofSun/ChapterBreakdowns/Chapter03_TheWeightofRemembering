# Adaptive Worldbuilding Chapter Analysis

## Chapter Overview
* **Citation:** [Blood of the Wild Gods: The Lost Histories, "Seven Days of Sun" - Chapter 3: "The Weight of Remembering"]
* **Summary:** Following their confrontation, Senia endures four days of Elodias's absence while struggling with inexplicable grief and supernatural recognition. When she finally confronts him at his cabin, demanding the truth, Elodias reveals a devastating supernatural law: "if I tell you the truth, you will die in seven days." This establishes the central tragic premise—knowledge itself is lethal in their supernatural relationship, and the story's title reveals its literal meaning as a countdown to Senia's death.

* **Worldbuilding Impact:** Introduces the concept of **lethal knowledge**—where certain truths about their relationship carry deadly consequences for Senia. Establishes the seven-day timeframe as literal rather than metaphorical, creating urgency and revealing the cyclical nature of their tragedy. Demonstrates how supernatural grief affects both the immortal being and the reincarnated soul across the separation.
