## Chapter Overview
* **Citation:** [Blood of the Wild Gods: The Lost Histories, "Seven Days of Sun" - Chapter 1: "The Sun-Kissed Stall"]
* **Summary:** In the coastal village of Quenos, a mysterious stranger named Elodias has spent weeks observing fruit vendor Senia from the shadows before finally approaching her stall. Their daily interactions evolve from simple commerce to deeper connection, culminating in him asking for a date in exchange for a peach. The chapter establishes an atmosphere of supernatural romance with undertones of predestination and hidden danger, as Elodias appears to be more than human and their connection seems to transcend normal attraction.

* **Worldbuilding Impact:** Establishes the coastal setting of Quenos as a small, tight-knit community where strangers are noticed and gossiped about. Introduces the broader geographic feature of the Azure Expanse and hints at supernatural forces at work beneath the surface of everyday village life.
