Katalina Petari represents one of the story's most heartbreaking tragedies - the loss of authentic human connection to religious extremism. Her transformation from gentle, questioning soul-sister to zealous missionary shows how totalist movements destroy not just individuals but the relationships that give life meaning. Her departure for the dangerous Blackwater Falls mission represents the ultimate sacrifice of love for ideology, leaving Mira utterly alone at her moment of greatest need. The wooden starling she carves becomes a symbol of what was lost - the dreams of freedom and adventure they once shared, now impossible as one friend chooses perceived salvation over genuine connection.
