# Dominic - Complete Character Profile

## Character Summary

Dominic embodies the raw, unfiltered rage of the resistance movement—a man whose personal trauma has been weaponized into a blunt instrument against Zenithian oppression. Where Meridia calculates and manipulates, Dominic burns with the righteous fury of someone who has lost everything to systematic persecution and refuses to let that loss be forgotten or forgiven.

Weathered by years of hardship and marked by the brutal realities of life as one of the Forsaken, he represents the faction within the resistance that prioritizes immediate, violent action over long-term strategy. His grizzled exterior and suspicious nature reflect a man who has learned that survival depends on constant vigilance and that trust is a luxury the Forsaken cannot afford.

As Meridia's lieutenant and enforcer, Dominic serves as both the muscle of their operations and the voice of their collective trauma. His explosive temperament and willingness to employ brutal methods make him invaluable for certain types of missions, yet also dangerous to the strategic patience that Meridia favors. He is a man driven not by ideology or grand vision, but by the simple, burning need to make those who destroyed his life pay the same price.

His interactions with captured enemies reveal the depth of his pain—not just anger at persecution, but grief for the family connections severed, the belonging destroyed, the fundamental human dignity stripped away by Zenithian doctrine. When he speaks of being "torn apart" and "forgotten," he gives voice to the collective wound that drives the entire Forsaken resistance movement.

Dominic represents the dangerous reality that oppression creates its own monsters—people so damaged by systematic cruelty that they become mirrors of what they fight against, unable to distinguish between justice and revenge, between necessary resistance and brutal retribution.

## Final Character Summary

Dominic represents the dangerous alchemy of legitimate grievance transformed into destructive rage. His character embodies the reality that systematic oppression creates its own monsters—people so damaged by persecution that they become mirrors of what they fight against, unable to distinguish between justice and revenge, between necessary resistance and brutal retribution.

As Meridia's lieutenant and enforcer, he serves as both the muscle of their operations and the unfiltered voice of Forsaken trauma. His explosive temperament and willingness to employ brutal methods make him invaluable for certain types of missions, yet also dangerous to the strategic patience that long-term resistance requires. He is living proof that the line between protector and predator can disappear when survival requires moral compromise.

His interrogation of the captured Zenithian reveals the depth of his wound—not just anger at persecution, but grief for family connections severed, belonging destroyed, fundamental human dignity stripped away by religious extremism. When he speaks of being "torn apart" and "forgotten," he gives voice to the collective trauma that drives the entire Forsaken resistance movement.

Through Dominic, the story explores the uncomfortable truth that oppression creates cycles of violence, that victims can become victimizers, and that the fight against monsters often requires adopting monstrous methods. His character asks whether there is a point where the cure becomes worse than the disease, where the resistance becomes indistinguishable from what it opposes.

Yet beneath his brutality lies genuine pain and a legitimate desire to protect others from experiencing what he has endured. His rage, however destructive, springs from a fundamentally human place—the need for dignity, belonging, and justice. He represents both the necessity and the danger of violent resistance, the price paid by those who sacrifice their own humanity to protect others.

Dominic's ultimate trajectory will likely determine not just his own fate, but the moral character of the entire resistance movement. Whether he can learn to channel his trauma into constructive action, or whether he will be consumed by the very violence he wields, remains one of the central tensions in the larger struggle between oppression and liberation, between becoming what you fight and remaining who you choose to be.
