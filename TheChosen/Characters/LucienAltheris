## Ultimate Danger
Lucien represents the intersection of supernatural power, racial supremacy, religious extremism, and personal corruption. His Vaelari heritage makes him far more dangerous than any mortal antagonist - he has centuries of experience, supernatural abilities, and the resources of an entire otherworldly realm potentially behind him. His pursuit of Mira is not just personal obsession but an existential crisis - if a "mere" void creature can resist his divine authority, it challenges everything he believes about his own superiority and destiny.

His discovery of Mira's Nimwe nature transforms their conflict from domestic abuse into cosmic warfare between light and void, order and chaos, angelic authority and primordial darkness. He cannot simply let her go - her existence as someone beyond his control threatens to unravel his entire worldview and mission.
