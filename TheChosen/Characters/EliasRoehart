He sees her wild spirit as both beautiful and dangerous, leading to overprotective tendencies.

Described as "not like us" and walking "a different path" - heavily implied to be Nimwe or connected to void creatures. Her departure left him to raise Mira alone while guarding dangerous secrets about their daughter's true nature.

Elias Roehart represents the tragedy of love that fails to prepare its object for the real world. His protective instincts, while genuine, ultimately leave Mira vulnerable and alone when she needs support most. His conversion to Zenithianism shows how even thoughtful individuals can fall prey to extremist manipulation, especially when they carry burdens of guilt and seek community after years of isolation. His departure marks a crucial turning point in Mira's story, removing her last anchor and pushing her toward the despair that eventually leads to her awakening.
